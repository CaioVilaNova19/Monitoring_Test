    "# Transaction Anomaly Monitoring System\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook serves as a practical guide to setting up, running, and understanding the transaction anomaly monitoring system. It demonstrates the integration of a Flask API for real-time processing, an SQLite database for persistence, and an interactive dashboard for visualizing metrics and alerts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main objective is to detect transactional behaviors that deviate from the norm (such as an abnormally high number of denied, failed, or reversed transactions) and notify responsible teams, in addition to providing continuous overview on the dashboard."
